Coding Quiz

In this asignment we were tasked with creating an application that ran a quiz with basic coding questions. Additionally we were told to add a timer that would countdown and have time deducted in the event of a wrong answer. Finally the instructions asked that we include a highscore section where the score of a user was saved locally up quiz completion.
